A heartbeat’s whisper, raw and true,
In volts and noise, it hid its clue.

With NeuroKit, I cleaned each line,
A wandering trace turned smooth, divine.
From peaks I drew the pulse’s tale,
Each 5-minute beat, I did unveil.

HRV, both time and wave,
Where balance speaks and rhythms crave.
Nonlinear curves and spectral light,
Unwrapped the strain from day to night.

And PSI, that final score,
Told stories sweating on the floor.
Thermal rise and heart’s reply,
Mapped the strain, both low and high.
